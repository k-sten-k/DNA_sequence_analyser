# Project_3-DNA-sequence-analyser

The DNA Sequence Analyser is a Python program designed to analyse DNA sequences. It offers a range of functionalities for sequence analysis and manipulation, as well as predicting traits based on genetic markers. 

Main features of the program:
1.	Sequence Input: Users can input DNA sequences directly via text entry.
2.	Basic Sequence Analysis:
•	Calculates the length of the DNA sequence.
•	Determines nucleotide frequencies and displays them graphically.
•	Segments the DNA sequence based on a specified nucleotide marker.
3.	Sequence Manipulation:
•	Generates the reverse complement of the DNA sequence.
•	Transcribes DNA into RNA sequence.
4.	Sequence Search:
•	Searches for specific patterns in the DNA sequence.
•	Replaces nucleotide patterns in the sequence.
•	Identifies genetic markers and predicts possible traits.


Python features used:
1.	Functions: The program is organized into functions to modularize code and improve readability. 
2.	Data Structures (Dictionaries): A dictionary (genetic_markers) is used to map genetic markers to their corresponding traits. This dictionary facilitates the identification of genetic markers and the prediction of traits within DNA sequences.
3.	Control Structures (Loops and Conditionals): The program utilizes loops and conditionals to implement iterative processes and handle user input validation. 
4.	String Manipulation: Various string manipulation techniques include splitting DNA sequences into segments, replacing nucleotide patterns, and transcribing DNA into RNA sequences.
5.	External Libraries: The program makes use of external libraries such as Matplotlib for generating graphical representations of nucleotide frequencies and Colorama for displaying colored output in the terminal.
6.	Error Handling (Exception Handling): Exception handling is used to catch and handle errors, ensuring the program gracefully handles invalid user input or unexpected situations.
7.	User Interface: The program provides a user-friendly interface with clear prompts and menu options, enhancing the overall user experience.

This program was developed as a learning exercise and tool for DNA sequence analysis. It utilizes basic concepts of genetics and bioinformatics.
